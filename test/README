## general tools

comparison.C : root macro which compares two distributions making ratio
Compare2files.C : adaptation of comparison.C to compare electron ID and ISO var from 
                  signal and bckgrnd (with cuts marked)
stage_in.pl : shell script to prestage files on castor 
prestage.sh : perl script to prestage files on castor
copyFromCastor.pl : copy from Castor :)


## tools for analysis in CMSSW_1_6_x

AnalyzeRootNtuples
LLFit_and_Significance
efficiency.C , plotEff.C : plots used for electron efficiency
submitWithCrab : script to make automatic submission with crab of several datasets
(to be adapted..)

## tools used in CMSSW_2_1_8

elecRecoEff.C : plots electron reconstruction eff with no cuts, ID only and ID+ISO
plotElecEff.C : adaptation of plotEff.C to run with elecRecoEff.C 
LQGenPlots : plots at gen level
ele_muon_effAndRatio.C: plot electron and muon efficiencies as output from /rootNtu
pleMacros/src/analysisClass_elecStudies2.C and /rootNtu
pleMacros/src/analysisClass_muonStudies2.C and calculate ratio eff_e/eff_mu for ttbar background estimate
